Today I’m going to start a new series of blog posts unrelated to my typical programming affair. This is actually an out-growth of a prior failed attempt to create a podcast, and if this series proves popular enough I might try again.

So, why am I doing this? Well, obviously this is partly a response to being quarantined 24/7 during the Coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. Without the ability to leave the house, there is only so many video games that a given person can play without slowly losing their mind. But more importantly I have a wide ranging interest in history and mechanical engineering, which both has a wider audience and a larger range of subject material than software engineering can offer. The result is that I probably have more to say about my non-programming interests than I do about my programming interests.

This series will be roughly broken down by category, with a cluster of articles focusing on thematically connected subjects. I haven’t mapped out every single subject that I want to cover, but I know that I want to at least cover historical fencing and clocks/watches. If this series turns out to be moderately popular (or fun to write), I’ll add more subjects later.

Without further ado, let’s get into this thing.
