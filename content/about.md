Programmer, father, fisherman, and all around nerd. By day I'm an engineer, and by night I'm a nerd, or is that redundant?

At my day job I am a manager and engineer working for [Uber](https://www.uber.com) in Aarhus Denmark.

Professionally, my experience is all over the place. I've worked in old small companies, startups, Dell backed consultancies, and finance. In the mean time I've written code in Java, C\#, Ruby, Javascript, Clojure, Python, and even Common Lisp! And that's only counting the languages that I've been paid to write in.
