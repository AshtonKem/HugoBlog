two to both produce, and produce good work.

<p>Part of my new job at <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pivotal Tracker</a>
involves pair programming. While a lot of my programming friends express
doubt about pairing, I&rsquo;m very impressed with both how productive I am

<p>The way that a good pair switches between who is &ldquo;driving&rdquo; is very
similar to Merlin&rsquo;s talk. The person who is typing is responsible for
producing, while the person who isn&rsquo;t is responsible for ensuring that
the pair is headed in the right direction. Pairs have a much easier time
finding this balance and staying on track than individual workers do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to alternate between time and attention effectively when
working alone. There&rsquo;s no overt signal to when one is using time or
attention, making it easy to mistake &ldquo;research&rdquo; (reading Wikipedia) as
using your attention. As a pair this balance is much easier to achieve,
because each member is tasked with one role, and it&rsquo;s obvious when that
role is not being fulfilled. The non-driving member can&rsquo;t goof off on
Reddit or Wikipedia for the sake of &ldquo;research&rdquo; because it will prevent
the driving member from working. And the driving member can&rsquo;t slow down
too much without the other member taking over typing from them. This
helps ensure that the pair produces better code faster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if the creators of pair programming are familiar with
Merlin&rsquo;s model of work, but accidentally or not they&rsquo;ve made it much
easier for programmers to follow his advice. I&rsquo;d recommend any
company to give pairing a try and see what it does for the quality and
quantity of work that their teams produce.</p>
