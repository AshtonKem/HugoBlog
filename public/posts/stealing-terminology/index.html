<p>My most recent borrowed term is <em>Force Multiplier</em>. A force multiplier is anything that allows an group or individual to be more effective without an increase in effort. It&rsquo;s normally a military term referencing how better weather forecasts, equipment, or intelligence can allow a unit to accomplish much more without increasing effort/losses. I like to use it in reference to things like unit tests and automation, that make me more effective as an engineer without costing me more time. If I don&rsquo;t have to babysit a build waiting to type in the next step, then I can get back to work while a CI server works for me. I&rsquo;m instantly more effective without actually spending more time at work. With a comprehensive suite of unit tests I can spend less time worrying and validating that my refactoring has damaged the quality of the system, thus I can get more work done in the same period of time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are far more examples of this than I&rsquo;ve listed, but they&rsquo;re always fun to find and analyze.</p>
