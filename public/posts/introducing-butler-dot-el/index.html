<p>I eventually decided that Eclipse was overkill for Python development, and way too heavy for a Macbook Air. But in my switch back to Emacs I particularly missed my Jira and Jenkins plugins. This is why I&rsquo;m writing to announce the 0.1.0 release of <a href="https://github.com/AshtonKem/Butler"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Butler</a>. Butler allows for you to view the jobs on your Jenkins servers, and trigger new jobs without switching out of Emacs.</p>
<p>At this point Butler&rsquo;s feature set is modest: view, refresh, and trigger. These are just the groundwork functions for a larger feature set in the coming weeks, including console output, visual indication of running jobs, watching jobs, build queue, etc. I have high hopes that in a few months this plugin will be as mature as its eclipse counterpart.</p>
<p>If you have any bugs or feature requests, please add them to the Github issue tracker.</p>
